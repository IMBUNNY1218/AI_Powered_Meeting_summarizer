# AI_Powered_Meeting_summarizer

We have used "Wispher" for extracting the text from the audio file, and diarization. 
We used opensource "AI GPT for all" which is an offline GPT used for the summarization of the meeting and also highlighting the key points.
"Trello API" is also involved to display the tasks and to mannage them using the trello website by creating boards and cards from the summary of the meeting
